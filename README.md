GrubList Restaurant App

My App let's a user search through all restaurants located in Austin, TX, review their cuisine and website, and then add it to their list of favorite restaurants. It's like a playlist but for food. 

The welcome page is the first thing the user is greeted with. From there, they can either sign up and make an account or log in if they are a returning user. The landing page is the Home page where they can search any key word in the search bar and the necessary restaurants will pop up. Zomato's API provides over 4,000 matches in their database. The user can click on individual places to see more details of the restaurant including a url to their website.

From the Home page the user can navigate to their profile page to filter to their chosen favorite places to eat.
